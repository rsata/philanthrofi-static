        <h1>Our belief</h1>
        <p>We believe that advertising is a tool for social good, one that creates a virtuous cycle where engaging in CSR not only helps the charity, but also benefits in the business.  Weâ€™re building this cycle where brands promote their CSR initiatives through a network of local publications, which in turn, grow their viewership, broaden their reach, and showcase the brands that are promoting CSR.</p>
