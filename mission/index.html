      <p>We're on a mission to use advertising budgets for social good.</p>
      <h3>Our belief</h3>
      <p>We believe that advertising is a tool for social good, one that creates a virtuous cycle where engaging in CSR not only helps the charity, but also benefits in the business.  We’re building this cycle where brands promote their CSR initiatives through a network of local publications, which in turn, grow their viewership, broaden their reach, and showcase the brands that are promoting CSR.</p>
      <h3>Our plan</h3>
      <p>We’re on a mission to redefine advertising in a historic way.  At Adpactor, we envision a world where advertising budgets become CSR budgets, promoting brands through the efforts they are making to give back to local communities.</p>
