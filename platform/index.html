      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <p>Adpactor gives companies a way to involve the public in their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.  Through our local networks of publications and non profits, we let the public decide where to deploy resources and volunteer hours in the name of Corporate Philanthropy.  Our Impact Advertisements engage the public in our common goal to promote CSR initiatives and increase donations to charitable organizations.</p>
