      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <p>Adpactor gives companies a way to involve the public in their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.  Through our local networks of publications and nonprofits, we let the public decide where to deploy resources and volunteer hours in the name of Corporate Philanthropy.  Our Impact Advertisements engage the public in our common goal to promote CSR initiatives and increase donations to charitable organizations.</p>

      <p>Each month, brands pledge volunteer hours, donations, and/or pro-bono work to the nonprofit community.</p>

      <p>The Adpactor platform creates impact ads and distributes them to our network of publishers related to the brand.</p>

      <p>At the end of the month, Adpactor tells the brands where to make their donations based on the responses from the impact ads.</p>
