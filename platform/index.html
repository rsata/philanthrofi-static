      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>Upright gives companies a way to involve the public in their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.  Through our local networks of publications and non-profits, we let the [consumer, reader, ...] decide where to deploy resources and volunteer hours in the name of Corporate Philanthropy.  Our [posts / ads / ads+] engage the public in our common goal to promote CSR initiatives and increase donations to charitable organizations.</p>
